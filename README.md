WebGL-PathTrace
===============

This WebGL path tracer is created by Ashima and Yue Hu as a part of our final project for CIS 565: GPU Programming, Fall 2012, at the University of Pennsylvania.

We have two folders for different functionality. Subsurface scattering folder has code which represent subsurface scattering effect. The other folder named path tracer has basic path tracer with
refraction and reflection.

We created two different files as subsurface scattering does not work on many machines.
